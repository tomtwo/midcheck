# midcheck

Simple NodeJS program to notify clients by SMS when certain conditions are met on a web page's source content.

------

## Installation & Execution

First: you'll need an activated Twilio account. Free trial works OK.

Then:

    git clone https://github.com/tomtwo/midcheck
    cd midcheck && npm install
    # Configure package.json with Twilio API credentials and target SMS number
    # Modify app.js to include your checks
    npm start

It's recommended to background this process, so that it can continuously keep checking. For example, you may use nohup:

    nohup npm start &

## Configuration

### package.json

In package.json, you must configure Twilio's API credentials and the app's configuration:

      "twilio": {
        "sid": "<YOUR SID HERE>",
        "token": "<YOUR TOKEN HERE>",
        "sourceNumber": "<YOUR TWILIO PHONE NUMBER HERE>"
      },
      "config": {
        "destinationNumbers": ["<PHONE NUMBER TO ALERT>"],
        "checkIntervalSeconds": <INTERVAL IN SECONDS TO CHECK PAGES>
      }

### app.js

In app.js, the main app's logic is contained. You must add checks by calling _checker.addCheck()_:

    checker.addCheck("SYSTEM007", 
                     "http://www.wearesystem.co.uk/product/systm007-las-backyard-tic", 
                     function(page) {

        // Return true iff "Coming Soon" is not present
        return !(/(Coming Soon)/.test(page));

    });

Arguments:

- name (string): A name for the check, which is quoted when users are notified
- url (string): The URL for which to perform the check on
- callback(page) (function): Callback which to perform your synchronous analysis of the page, returning true when the client should be alerted

## Future work

Currently this project is fairly flexible for basic use cases. In future, all synchronous calls should probably be removed - it's not the NodeJS way!

Also, I'm not sure about the current configuration split between package.json and app.js. I may move more app logic out of app.js and move the configuration in from package.json.
